# Sign-in frontend

#### This project uses Create-React-App, TypeScript, Styled Components and React Testing Library.

### Directions

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to `npm install` first!</li>
  <li>Start the app on a dev server with `npm start`. Application should work fine in desktop or mobile-desktop view.</li>
  <li>Run the test suite with `npm test`.</li>
</ul>

### Stretch goals:

<p>Upon reflection, there are a few things I would have liked to change given more time. I did not fully modularize the forms - this would have helped with testing, which I did not have time to complete. I was not provided any design assets so I created my own SVGs. And I have not worked in a production environment using TypeScript + Styled Components together so there were some conflicting pieces (see ISCToastProps vs IToastProps) - I was not sure what would be considered "best practices" to resolve. This was a small enough project that I didn't feel the need to be constrained by a linter but that's probably the next thing I would add.</p>
